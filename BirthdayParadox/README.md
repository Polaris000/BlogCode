The `births.ipynb` houses code from my Medium article titled "Dissecting the Birthday Paradox", published in TowardsDataScience -- Medium's top datascience publication.

You can find the post [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/dissecting-the-birthday-paradox-c26754aff6b5).

The notebook contains experiments on real world births data from the US trying to see how this paradox holds in the real world.
