## Dynamic Programming

This is the example used in my blogpost [Understanding Dynamic Programming](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-dynamic-programming-75238de0db0d), published in [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/), the top data science publication on [Medium](https://medium.com).

The post discusses:
* Dynamic Programming in general
* Approaching a dynamic programming problem
* An example solved with an inefficient resursive approach and later improved

The code here is the final result that is achieved in the article.

### Contents
You'll find a few txt files containing pseudocode for the various approaches used in the post.
They're named accordingly.

There's also a c++ file containing the code for the final most efficient approach explained in the post.


### Usage
1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to this directory
3. Setup C++ locally if it isn't already set up.

Simply execute:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Polaris000/BlogCode.git 
$ cd DynamicProgramming
$ cpp constant_space_bottom_up.cpp
```
