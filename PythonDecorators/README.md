## PythonImportExample

This is the example code used in my blogpost [Python: Decorators in OOP](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-decorators-in-oop-3189c526ead6), published in [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/), the top data science publication on [Medium](https://medium.com).

The blog post talks about decorators and walks through an example. The sample class in the post goes through several iterations as we increase its complexity.

The code here is the final result that is achieved in the article.
